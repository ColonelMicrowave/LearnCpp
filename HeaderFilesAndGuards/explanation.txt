First, getNumOfSides is defined in Shape.h (not recommended but used for the example)
Contents of Shape.h are also included in SecondShape.h
Both header files are included in main.cpp which takes the return value from getNumOfSides in Shape.cpp and prints it to the console
This would cause a compile error as there are duplicate getNumOfSides functions so compiler will not know which one to use in the int main() function
However the use of header guards will prevent this ("#ifndef" preprocessor command) as only one getNumOfSides function will be used

First, the preprocessor evaluates #ifndef SHAPE_H. SHAPE_H has not been defined yet, so the code from the #ifndef to the subsequent #endif is included for compilation. This code defines SHAPE_H, and has the definition for the getNumOfSides function.
Later, the next #ifndef SHAPE_H is evaluated. This time, SHAPE_H is defined (because it got defined above), so the code from the #ifndef to the subsequent #endif is excluded from compilation.
